        <p>The strengths is having a not much powerful personal computer to execute the programs that we will be having in the future and my I.T colleagues. My only weakness is professors that doesn't explain the topic of a certain lesson because I've encounter once in my senior high school year and He's a programming teacher. He doesn't always goes to our room to teach us and just gave us a programming problem without us knowing how to execute the code.</p>
